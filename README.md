Express.js (or "Express") is a NodeJS web framework used on the back-end (or server-side) of websites and web applications.
Express is flexible and minimalistic, which means that it doesnâ€™t have an extensive collection of unnecessary libraries and packages,
nor does it dictate how you should build your application. <br>
